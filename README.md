# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Title

Simple application that analyzes the financial records of a company using plain JavaScript.

## User Story

AS a DEVELOPER<br>
I WANT to write code that will analyse the financial records of a company<br>
SO THAT I can calculate the required data as follows:<br>

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The code should print the analysis to the console.

## Acceptance Criteria

IT IS DONE when you open the console in the browser and the resulting analysis looks similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

## Tasks Completed
